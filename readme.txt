== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I find my company domain? =

Your company domain is the website URL you registered with Rating Bulls, without the "https://" prefix. For example: "hexmarkets.com"

= How often is the data updated? =

By default, the plugin caches data for 6 hours. You can adjust this in the settings (1-24 hours) or manually clear the cache at any time.

= Can I customize the widget appearance? =

The widget uses CSS that can be overridden in your theme. All elements have specific class names prefixed with "rbr-" for easy targeting.

= What if my company isn't showing up? =

Make sure your company is listed on Rating Bulls and the domain matches exactly what's in your Rating Bulls profile. Contact Rating Bulls support if issues persist.

= How do automatic updates work? =

The plugin checks for updates from our GitHub repository. When a new version is available, you'll see it in your WordPress dashboard under Plugins > Updates, just like any other plugin. You can also manually check for updates from the Plugins page.
